    <p class="about_text">
      My passion for programming started back in 2010 when I was 14. I built my
      own script that automated tasks for an online role-playing game called
      RuneScape. It was awesome because I was able to complete objectives
      without human presence. Since then, I'm interested in how indviduals can
      protect themselves through cyber security as well as developing mobile
      apps for iOS and Android. I love challenging myself everyday in life and
      I'm always open to look at things through difference prespectives because
      it has helped me grow as a developer and person.
    </p>
    <p class="about_text">
      When I'm not programming, I am probably out running and competing in
      marathons or at the gym powerlifting. I also love traveling and spending
      time baking.
